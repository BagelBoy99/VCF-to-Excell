Originally was created for getting the contacts off of my dad's old work phone. 
Because of Apple's resistance to making anything user friendly, I needed something to parse raw VCF contents and I was not too keen on using some random site to accomplish this. 

This script turns each contact into a custom psobject then outputs it to grid view to easily find what you need. After selecting what you want you can pass it onto a spreadsheet. 

Hope this helps someone else with the same very specific use case.
